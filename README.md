- 👋 Hi, I’m @researcher-law
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about how to do e-discovery on the super cheap.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about how emails are coded and stored, how document searches are configured, and how litigators actually used/need to use the tech.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that try to simplify and reduce the costs of e-discovery so that broke lawyers or lawyers with clients with little money and big problems can compete in the legal arena.
- 📫 How to reach me... is there a messenger app in Github? Yeah, I'm a total noob.
